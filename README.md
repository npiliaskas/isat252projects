This file has been used to create "pythonian" and its related test file. 

The purpose of this project was to log specific makes and models of cars, with their respective mileage in both miles-pe- gallon and kilometers-per-litter. Once a car is entered with either mileage statistic, the program will use conversion functions to produce the other mileage statistic as well. 

This will create a mileage database which is useful to individuals in both the US, as well as other countries which use the metric system. It is also a useful conversion tool for those who wish to know the mileage of their car when traveling and purchasing gas in a country which makes uses of different units of measure.
